# Frequently asked questions

1. **What is Alignment Negotiation? As an apprentice, when do I use it?**

Once a mentoring agreement has already been established with a mentor, you can
initiate an Alignment Negotiation. This allows both of you to discuss and change
some terms about the mentoring agreement.

In production, these data will be lifted from your growth journal which
contains data about your growth, and metadata about your mentorship engagement.

2. **What does it do exactly?**

This alignment negotiation tool allows you to keep your mentoring engagement, to find
acceptable compromises when negotiating with your mentor/apprentice, and to discern 
if the mentoring engagement is still suitable for both of you.

Your reputation in both performance and negotiation is recorded publicly on the Solana blockchain.
This goes the same way for your mentor.

By clearly stating your expectations, enforcing your boundaries, and negotiating respectfully and
collaboratively you both grow your reputation as apprentice and a mentor.

3. **I'm unfamiliar with the terminologies you're using. Where can I read about that?**

Check the [definitions](definitions.md).

4. **What is a growth journal? Where can I see an example of a growth journal?**

Your growth journal content and metacontent is stored in YAML format in a public GitHub repository owned by you, where you have full authority to grant and revoke read/write access to past, present, and future mentors that you will engage with. This growth journal, along with a DSU repository, is what the smart contract interacts with automatically to evaluate your performance.

Check out our growth journal's generated public template to see how Tome.gg mentors are in involved in guiding you in your direction setting and growth- personalized specifically for you.

See an [example of a growth journal](https://www.tome.gg/assets/growth-report.pdf).

## MVP limitations

1. üìù This only a proof-of-concept that focuses on Alignment Negotiation, not establishing a Mentorship Engagement.

2. ‚ùå This makes the assumption that the Mentoring Engagement smart contract between the two parties already exists.

3. ‚ùå The Mentoring Engagement smart contract itself is not yet designed nor implemented.

4. ‚ùå The Tome Negotiation Protocols (e.g. DSU Transparency) already have been designed, but have not yet been implemented.
A dummy Solana account is used to represent the Negotiation Term and Protocol.
