## Definitions

1. **Mentoring Engagement** - An agreement between an apprentice and a mentor about rendering/receiving mentoring services.

2. **Alignment Negotiation** - A process initiated by any party in a mentoring engagement. The objective is to propose some change in parameters of the mentoring engagement, while also defining clear failure triggers, recovery options, and stakes between the parties.

3. **Failure triggers** - Conditions that represent a failure to do one's responsibility. These are part of the negotiated parameters of the alignment.

4. **Recovery options** - Options that allow one party to 'forgive' or start from a blemishless or clean state as if they have not made any mistakes approaching failure. These are part of the negotiated parameters of the alignment.

5. **Stakes** - What an individual loses by failing to do part of their responsibility (e.g. Mentor fails to do mentoring; apprentice fails to live up to commitments). These are part of the negotiated parameters of the alignment.
