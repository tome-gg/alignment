      <h2 class="text-2xl mt-8 mb-2 font-medium mb-4">Grounding truths</h2>
      <p class="my-4 text-gray-400">
        You don't have control over other people's opinions or perspectives of you.
        You have some control over your life. That little control? You can master it.
        You deserve a life that is not gripped by fear, anxiety, and complacency.
        You deserve a life that has peace.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-green-500 pl-4 py-2 my-4">
        <p class="my-4">
          You have control over your direction and your growth. Your pace and direction is yours,
          and nobody can tell you what you want, and how fast it will take you to get it.
          Direction and pace is yours.
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          You deserves a life that allows you to dream. Dreams that you can scribble, sketch, illustrate, and
          eventually cherish by bringing it to life. You deserve a life that is fully-lived.
        </p>
