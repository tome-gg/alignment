      <p>Your growth data isn't meant to be warehoused in some foreign company or lost in the Google
        Workspace of the company you just left. Why should you be prevented from your growth data, including both your
        struggles and perseverance in your growth and your mentor's and advisor's feedback?
      </p>
      <p class="sm:hidden">
        <strong>The value of your growth is only coincidentally useful to the company or the school that you are with
          as
          long as you are with them.</strong> Afterwards, your growth data is no longer valuable to them, but it is a
        huge loss for you.
      </p>
      <p class="sm:hidden">
        Your knowledge is the output of your growth. But your journey towards it-- that growth data is yours. It is
        your
        asset, and it is everyone's first asset. Ownership of your growth is one of the first steps towards
        financial freedom, sustainability, and self-actualization.
      </p>
      <p>This is why we developed the Tome.gg protocols: to teach others how to own and protect their data in the form
        of your own personal growth journal.</p>

        if not all of the skills you can acquire from your mentor.

        In Tome.gg, mentors guide you in how to write about your growth data such that you have

        The founder of Tome.gg practices this learn-in-public writing of their growth to demonstrate taking ownership
