            I built Tome.gg as a for-profit social enterprise because I saw the

            in the Philippines, and in the US.

        I graduated from De La Salle University Manila with a degree in Computer Science, one of the top universities in
        the Philippines. I completed my undergraduate degree in 2015, working on a thesis about computer vision. Then,
        in 2019, I finished my Master's in Computer Science, focusing my thesis on natural language processing.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        I fell in love with programming at age 12 and started selling software to clients when I was 18.

      <p class="my-4">
        Currently, I'm pursuing my MBA at Hult International Business School in San Francisco and have the privilege of
        being the president of the Hult EdTech Club.

      <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">Profession</h1>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Right after earning my undergraduate degree, I jumped into the tech world as a software engineer, initially
        diving into mobile front-end development for Android and iOS. I learned a lot from tackling UI optimizations,
        state management, and functional reactive programming.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        In 2017, I started building web-based applications at work, and by 2019, I launched my own tech consulting
        business. My journey continued as I took on roles as an engineering manager and software architect by 2021.

        with negotiations escalating to "new-job-interview-then-quit" approaches which
        discard all of their accumulated non-monetary assets like team reputation
        and influence, and strong relationships.

        communication styles and preferences, in method of instruction, in pace,
        and in content.
