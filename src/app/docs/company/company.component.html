        Hi there! You can call me <strong>Darren</strong>.
        I would describe myself as <i>a lifelong learner, and a generous classmate</i>.
      </p>
      <p class="pb-6">
        I worked as a tech consultant since 2019, and have worked in various roles
        such as software architect, software evangelist, engineering manager, and
        full-stack software engineer.
        I built Tome.gg as a for-profit social enterprise because I saw the
        great demand in high-quality senior-level software engineering talent
        in the Philippines, and in the US.
      </p>
      <p class="pb-6">
        Let me share my background and tell you about the heart-breaking stories
        I've heard from different apprentices I've worked with in the past.

        Darren is a computer-science graduate in De La Salle University Manila-
        one of the top universities in the Philippines. He finished his under-graduate
        degree in CS in 2015 (thesis relating to computer vision), and he
        completed his Masters in Computer Science (thesis relating to natural language processing)
        in 2019.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        He started programming at age 12 and started selling software to
        clients at 18.

      <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">Profession</h1>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Upon completion of his undergraduate degree, Darren worked as a software
        engineer starting with mobile front-end
        development (Android and iOS). Great challenges he learned here was
        UI optimizations, state management, and functional reactive programming.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        He began to develop web-based applications as part of his job by 2017,
        and started his tech consulting business in 2019. He later worked as an

        I've worked with engineering teams and individual apprentices that have found

        Some software engineers have felt lost and helpless when it comes to dealing

        I've met a lot of highly-proficient, deeply-technical software engineers that
        have struggled to understand how to better deliver value to their direct
        supervisors, CTOs, or the company. They also lack the familiarity in dealing
        with negotiations escalating to "new-job-interview-then-quit" approaches which
        discard all of their accumulated non-monetary assets like team reputation
        and influence, and strong relationships.

      <p class="mt-4">
        Throughout my journey in my 18+ years of programming and software engineering,
        I've learned what works best for me when it comes to learning.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        I've been
        teaching subjects (math, science, computer science) for over 15+ years in a
        variety of different roles and one of the keys to effective learning
        is personalization: in goals, in learning strategies and tactics, in
        communication styles and preferences, in method of instruction, in pace,
        and in content.
      </p>
      <p class="italic mt-4">
        How does one effectively discover these personalization dimensions of
        mentorship and learning?
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        We looked for the answers and collected it: the Tome.gg Protocols. It's free.
        Then we built a coaching and mentorship program for people who want
        to work with the best mentors to help them accelerate quickly.
