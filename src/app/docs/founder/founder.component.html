            Hi there! You can call me <strong>Darren</strong>.
            I would describe myself as <i>a lifelong learner, and a generous classmate</i>.

          <p class="pb-6">
            I worked as a tech consultant since 2019, and have worked in various roles
            such as software architect, software evangelist, engineering manager, and
            full-stack software engineer.
            I built Tome.gg as a for-profit social enterprise because I saw the
            great demand in high-quality senior-level software engineering talent
            in the Philippines, and in the US.

      <p class="mt-4">
        I graduated from De La Salle University Manila with a degree in Computer Science, one of the top universities in
        the Philippines. I completed my undergraduate degree in 2015, working on a thesis about computer vision. Then,
        in 2019, I finished my Master's in Computer Science, focusing my thesis on natural language processing.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        I fell in love with programming at age 12 and started selling software to clients when I was 18.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        Currently, I'm pursuing my MBA at Hult International Business School in San Francisco and have the privilege of
        being the president of the Hult EdTech Club.
      </p>
      <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">Profession</h1>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Right after earning my undergraduate degree, I jumped into the tech world as a software engineer, initially
        diving into mobile front-end development for Android and iOS. I learned a lot from tackling UI optimizations,
        state management, and functional reactive programming.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        In 2017, I started building web-based applications at work, and by 2019, I launched my own tech consulting
        business. My journey continued as I took on roles as an engineering manager and software architect by 2021.
